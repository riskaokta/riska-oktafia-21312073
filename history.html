                <p>The Technocrat Education Institute, which has been appointed as a pilot model for the national level Double 
                    System Education Program (link and match), was established on 19 February 1986 using the name “Technocrat 
                    Course and Guidance” with the permission of the Ministry of Education and Culture (Depdiknas) of Lampung 
                    Province. This institution was founded by Nasrullah Yusuf with a capital of a used Bajaj motorcycle which 
                    was sold for IDR 1,600,000. At the beginning of its establishment, it only used one building that was rented 
                    for Rp. 1,000,000 per year, with equipment designed by themselves, namely two chalkboards, 50 wooden chairs, 
                    one administrative desk, and a manual typewriter.</p>
                <p>The programs held at the beginning of its establishment were still limited to courses in English, Accounting, 
                    Tutoring, and Manual Typing. The learning community when it was first opened in March 1986 consisted of 32 
                    residents learning English (2 classes), 22 residents studying Accounting, and 8 residents learning manual 
                    typing. In May 1986 Tutoring began with 3 participants. There were only two teaching staff at that time, 
                    namely Nasrullah Yusuf himself who taught English, Accounting, Typing, Tutoring and concurrently 
                    administration, and Mrs. Hernaini Nasrul teaches English and Manual Typing.</p>
                <p>In 1995 the Technocrat Course and Guidance changed its name in the context of Indonesianization to become a 
                    Technocrat Educational Institution. This institution oversees two departments, namely the Department of 
                    Courses and Guidance, and the Department of Business and Management Education Institutions.
                    The Institute for Business and Management Education strives to continuously develop its educational 
                    programs. In 1996, the One-Year Technocrat Education Program began its learning process. Until now, 
                    the One-Year Technocrats Education Program has organized the One-Year Work Ready Education Program 
                    ECOMTEC (english computer technology information), computer accounting, computer graphic design, 
                    computer secretary, and English.</p>
                <p>From the rapid developments and achievements that have been achieved by the Technocrat Education
                    Institute, this Institute is trying to increase its participation in the intellectual life of the
                    nation, one of the efforts made is to establish a Technocrat College in 2000. This college consists 
                    of three institutions, namely the College of Informatics and Computer Management (STMIK) Technocrats, 
                    Academy of Informatics and Computer Management (AMIK) Technocrats and College of Foreign Languages ​​
                    (STBA) Technocrats.</p>
                <p>The College of Informatics and Computer Management (STMIK) Technocrats has received an operational 
                    permit and legal entity status on February 8, 2001 and has registered status at the Directorate 
                    General of Higher Education, Ministry of National Education with Number; 13/D/O/2001. STMIK 
                    Teknokrat has two undergraduate study programs, namely Informatics Engineering (IT) and Information 
                    Systems (IS). Both study programs have been accredited by the National Accreditation Board for 
                    Higher Education (BAN PT).</p>
                <p>The Academy of Informatics and Computer Management (AMIK) Technocrats has obtained an operational
                    license and legal entity status on June 9, 2000 and has registered status at the Directorate General
                    of Higher Education, Ministry of National Education Number: 92/D/O/2000. AMIK Technocrats has three 
                    Diploma Three study programs, namely Computer Accounting (KA), Informatics Management (MI) and Computer 
                    Engineering (TK). Since 2003 until now, the three study programs have been accredited by the National 
                    Accreditation Board for Higher Education (BAN PT).</p>
                <p>The Technical College of Foreign Languages (STBA) has received an operational permit and legal entity 
                    status on April 25, 2000 and has registered status at the Directorate General of Higher Education,

                    program, namely English Literature and two Diploma Three study programs, namely English and Japanese. 
                    Since 2003 until now, the three study programs at the Technocrat Foreign Language College have been 
                    accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Higher Education (BAN PT).</p>
                <p>The development of STMIK-AMIK-STBA Technocrat Higher Education is growing rapidly. The rapid development 
                    of STMIK-AMIK-STBA Technocrat Higher Education has been recognized at the international level, this is 
                    evidenced by the receipt of the ISO 9001:2008 International Quality Management Certificate issued by SAI 
                    Global from Australia for STMIK-AMIK-STBA Technocrat Higher Education.</p>    
                <p>In order to increase the contribution of the Technocrat Education Foundation in improving the quality of 
                    education in Indonesia, in 2015 the Technocrat Education Foundation took the initiative to increase the 
                    institutional capacity of the three higher education institutions (STMIK AMIK and STBA Teknokrat). In 
                    2015 the Technocrat Education Foundation submitted a proposal to the Directorate General of Higher 
                    Education to combine the three higher education institutions that were organized and transformed into 
                    a university. The efforts and hard work of the Technocrat Education Foundation finally paid off with 
                    the approval of the merger of STMIK-AMIK-STBA Teknokrat to become a University under the name of 
                    Universitas Teknokrat Indonesia with Decree Number 494/KPT/I/2017 which came into force on 18 September 
                    2017. The Universitas Teknokrat Indonesia held 3 faculties include the Faculty of Engineering and Computer 
                    Science, the Faculty of Economics and Business and the Faculty of Literature and Educational Sciences</p>
